        "summary": "Also known as Gruvw, I was born in 2002 in Switzerland. I started to learn how to code at the age of 10. Since then, I have fallen in love with programming and Computer Science in general. I learned a lot about programming by myself before studying Computer Science at EPFL and I wrote many projects (some of them are Open-Source, you can check them out on my GitHub). I highly customize my working environment (PDE) to perfectly fit my workflow/needs and edit text blazingly fast. I am passionate and very curious about everything, and I never miss an opportunity to learn.",

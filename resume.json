        "summary": "Also known as Gruvw, I was born in 2002 in Switzerland. I started to learn how to code at the age of 10. Since then, I have fallen in love with programming and Computer Science in general. I learned a lot about programming by myself before studying Computer Science at EPFL and I wrote many projects (some of them are Open-Source, you can check them out on my GitHub). I try to have as many professional experiences as possible in order to develop my skills further and to better understand professional environments. I love customizing my working environment to perfectly fit my workflows & needs. I am passionate and very curious about everything and never missing out an opportunity to learn.",

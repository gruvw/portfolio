In july 2020, I decided to build a website where I would be able to publish my different projects related to programming. That led to this website hosted on GitHub (powered by [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)).

## The concept

I had the idea of creating this kind of website a while ago.
I wanted something in between a portfolio website that is here to show of my work and amaze people and a medium blog where I would just publish my work in case someone was interested.
I also wanted a way to keep track of what I was doing and when.
Creating a website was a cool solution because when I finished a programming project I would just write a text about it, add some pictures if necessary and in one or two years come back to it and see my progression.

The only thing is that I wanted it to be really straight forward to publish my work on the website.
I didn't want to spend hours every single time I would write about something to style everything and make the article look great.
I wanted to write what I want and click on a button to publish it.
Markdown was the perfect solution for this:

* Very simple to format everything
* No waste of time writing tags and split into multiple divs...
* Easy to include links and photos

This fitted perfectly the need that I had.

The only issue about it was to actually create the website from scratch...
I would have had to make:

* A program that converted my markdown files into html
* The landing page
* Create styles for the website
* Make everything responsive
* Create an easy way to publish new projects
* ...

This is why I did not make the website earlier.
I was often thinking about it but I was too lazy to do everything and I preferred spending time on more interesting and newer projects.

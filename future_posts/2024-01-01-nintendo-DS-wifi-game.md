Programming a Nintendo DS game and adding Wi-Fi capabilities.

## üß† Concept

I took a course at EPFL that teached students on programming "microprogrammed embedded systems".
We used the [Nintendo DS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS){:target="_blank"} Lite as the platform to practice and program what we learned.  
I decided to build a [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe){:target="_blank"} clone on an Nintendo DS and later add Wi-Fi functionalities to enable two player games on two different devices.

**Note**: I strongly encourage you to look at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gruvw/epfl-nds-game){:target="_blank"} of the project if you are interested.
The README is very detailed and goes deep into the technicalities.

## üèÅ Result

Here is a short video demonstrating the resulting game:

</div>

The quality of the video is not perfect but we can see the game running correctly.  
I start by showcasing the game on a single device and then bring a second Nintendo DS and play using a Wi-Fi connection.

I programmed a computer to learn how to play the game Snake on its own.

## A High-School Project

In my high school, I needed to create a rated project that I will submit on my last year. We could choose any project we want but I already knew that I wanted something related to programming.
I was watching the videos of a youtuber called [CodeBullet](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0e3QhIYukixgh5VVpKHH9Q). He is programming small artificial intelligence projects and that inspired me to program something similar for my project.

## The Concept

I decided to recreated two programs that CodeBullet did on his channel:

1. The first program that I coded was a way for me to get in touch with machine learning. The purpure is simple: you have a population of dots that need to find a way to reach a target located behind an obstacle. In the beginning the dots don't know anything about their environnement so they move randomly. I want the dots to find a way to go around the obstacle and reach the goal. In order to achieve that, I used a genetic algorithm with natural selection.
2. The second program is the more important one. I wanted to make a computer learn by itself how to play the famous game [Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)). I did this by using artificial neural networks combined with a more advanced genetic algorithm (than the one in my first program) and natural selection.

I will not detail everything in this article because I already wrote a whole document (the one I needed to write in order to submit my project in my school) explaining everything about how I did it.

## The Result

This is a video of my first program in action:

I designed my own smart watch home screen and customized it the way I wanted it to be.

## ðŸ’Ž The envy

just bought xiaomi band, tried some faces, wanted mine

## ðŸ›  The Creation

### How to do it

looked for a tuto -> found one <https://c.mi.com/thread-2281025-1-0.html>

### Design

essentially images not really coding, Adobe PhotoShop -> too expensive: paint.net

### Export

Formatting and telling the program what were my images using json, Using the .exe program to generate the .bin (and the images ?)

### How it looks

like that

## ðŸš€ Publication

named it Â«Gruvw RainbowÂ», published my face where I found the one I tried in the beginning, <https://amazfitwatchfaces.com/mi-band-4/view/3018>, > 800 views and > 280 downloads, very happy about it, bit wired thinking someone could be looking to his watch with my face on it right now

## ðŸ“„ Conclusion

Satisfied about what I have done, not a big project, side project, still about one full time weekend xD, not wearing my mi band anymore but still happy to learned a way to customise a watch face, more design thant coding, still interesting tho

        "summary": "Also know as Gruvw, I was born in 2002 in Switzerland. I started to learn how to code at the age of 10. Since then, I have fallen in love with programming and Computer Science in general. I learned almost everything that I know about programmation by myself and I have had, since the beginning, a 'practice to learn' policy. Therefore I make lots of projects here and there in order to put theory into practice.  I also try to have as much professional experiences as I can in order to know if I really want to do this as a job and for now the answer has always been yes. All of this led me to where I am today, still passionate and curious about everything and never missing out an opportunity to learn.",
